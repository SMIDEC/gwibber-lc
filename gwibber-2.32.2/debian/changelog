  * New upstream release
    - Better facebook api_key handling
    - Only download content from facebook that we haven't already downloaded 
      yet (LP: #595265)
    - Cache the results of the friends query from facebook so we don't make so 
      many redundant calls and download duplicate data (LP: #595265)
    - Added a CouchDB view for getting max_message_time and a method for
      looking it up per operation, using this value to only get content
      newer than the latest record we have stored 
    - All of these fixes are related to reducing the number of calls we 
      we make to facebook and reducing the size of the result.  Facebook 
      throttles application wide, not per-user based on usage. This throttling
      is the root cause for (LP: #552227) and (LP: #595265) and probably many
      other bug reports where facebook rejects gwibber.
    - Merged in the latest version of facelib.py
    - Don't fail when we get valid error codes back from facebook, log them.
    - Bump the map_async timeout up to make sure it is higher than the pycurl 
      timeouts
    - Bump the pycurl.TIMEOUT to 150 and use default for pycurl.CONNECTTIMEOUT
